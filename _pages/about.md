Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll discover an array of exciting projects, ranging from geospatial analysis to environmental planning.

My interests lie at the intersection of geospatial science and strategic planning, where I aim to foster a hybrid and systemic approach to tackling complex environmental challenges. I strive to amplify and disseminate the irreplaceable role of landscape architecture in addressing environmental degradation and climate change.

I have programming experience in Python, Javascript, and R. Explore the projects page and blog to learn more about my academic journey and find inspiration.
