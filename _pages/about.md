Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll discover an array of exciting projects, ranging from geospatial analysis to environmental planning.

My interests lie at the intersection of geospatial science and strategic planning, where I aim to foster a hybrid and systemic approach to tackling complex environmental challenges. This passion led me to pursue graduate studies at UC Berkeley, where studio projects exploring the intricacies of river dynamics and human-wildlife conflicts have shaped my design philosophy. I strive to consider the pivotal role of landscape architecture in addressing environmental degradation and climate change.

As a result, I am committed to promoting a healthy, equitable, and sustainable urban environment through a multidisciplinary lens. My current research focuses on uncovering the relationships between urban heat islands and urban pollution at both neighborhood and national levels. Explore the projects page and blog to learn more about my journey and find inspiration.
