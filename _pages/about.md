Hi there, and welcome to my website! Here, you'll discover a variety of exciting projects, ranging from geospatial analysis to environmental planning.

My interests lie at the intersection of geospatial science and strategic planning, where I strive to leverage spatially explicit approaches to address environmental challenges and drive meaningful policy change. Through coursework in applied remote sensing, spatial ecology, and GIS science, I have developed strong technical skills in GIS and programming, including supervised classification, object-based image analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and species distribution modeling. For my thesis, I am investigating the relationships between urban heat and air pollution, as well as how landscape patterns influence these dynamics, with a focus on Denton County, TX.

Explore the projects and blog page to learn more about my academic journey and find inspiration!
