This fundamental studio class aims to cultivate our design lens and instill fundamental landscape design principles. 

My final design product is dedicated to helping users of this space to increase their sense of the creek through the construction of formal and informal space, stormwater infrastructure, and a time-sensitive scenery.

The project began with a collective site analysis of Strawberry Creek. Our group was interested in comparing people's perception of the creek based on different body senses, including visual, thermal, and hearing senses.

In the following phases, I contiuned using creek perception as the central theme and developed iterative ideas through shadow constructions.

Finally, three sections and renderings were digitially made to illustrate the project.
